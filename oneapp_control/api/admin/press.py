"""Talking to Frappe Cloud, and degrading rather than failing when it is down.

The control plane holds intent — the plan, the quotas, who owns it. Press
holds what is actually running. When those disagree the answer is nearly
always in press, so the tenant page reads it live rather than caching a copy
that can be wrong in a way nobody notices.

Every one of these degrades rather than raising: press being unreachable
should grey out a panel, not take down the page that would tell an operator
why the site is unhappy.
