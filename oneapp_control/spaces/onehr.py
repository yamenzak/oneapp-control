"""OneHR — the people, their time, their pay and how they got here.

Read `docs/ERP-SPACES.md` first: it is the argument for cutting ERPNext into
three spaces rather than shipping it whole, and this is the third and by far
the largest of them.

HRMS ships around two hundred doctypes. Nearly all of them are real and almost
none of them is a *place a person goes to work* — Leave Ledger Entry is an
accounting artefact, Employee Property History is an audit trail, Salary Detail
is a row inside a slip. The desk cannot tell the difference, so its HR workspace
is a wall of links and the first thing every HR officer does is learn which
nine of them they actually use.

So this space is a choice, and the choice is the product. Twenty-nine screens
under seven headings, every one of them somewhere a person has a job to do, and
everything else reachable the way it should be — as the far end of a link on a
record that needed it.

Two things beyond the choosing are worth naming.

**Pay is a separate seat.** Every HR department in the world keeps salary away
from the people who administer leave, and ERPNext's answer is a role list you
assemble by hand. Here it is one of three declared roles, so a workspace that
entitles OneHR gets the separation without having thought about it, and merging
the two is a decision somebody makes rather than one they inherit.

**A person is not a form.** Opening somebody shows their face, who they report
to, who reports to *them*, and their leave, attendance, payslips and claims —
all of it drawn by the same showcase a project uses, from a manifest.

**Generally available.**

#
# An HR officer administers leave, attendance, hiring and appraisals and in most

# finds out until they do.
#
# So `payroll` is a seat here, and the Pay screens belong to it alone. A
