"""OneCRM — leads, the deals they become, and what was quoted against them.

Read `docs/ERP-SPACES.md` first: it is the argument for cutting ERPNext into
three spaces rather than shipping it whole, and this is the second of them.

Over ERPNext's own CRM doctypes, which is the unglamorous right answer: a lead,
an opportunity and a quotation are solved problems, and a second schema for them
would be a second set of rows for the accounting side of the same workspace to
fail to see. What is ours is the presentation and one thing the schema was
missing.

The presentation first. ERPNext's CRM module ships twenty-six doctypes and its
workspace shows most of them, so a salesperson's list of places to go includes
Market Segment and Competitor Detail. Here there are nine places to work and a
Setup heading with six tables under it, and the screens open as the thing they
are: the pipeline is a board of deals by sales stage, the follow-ups are a
calendar of what was promised to whom, the leads are a board of how far each one
got, and each screen carries a dashboard measured over exactly the rows it is
showing.

And the thing that was missing: **a next step**. ERPNext records what a deal is
worth and when it is expected to close, and has nowhere at all to say what
happens next or when. That is the field a salesperson works out of, and without
it the only way to run a week is to open every record in turn. Two fields — see
CUSTOM_FIELDS — and the whole Follow-ups screen falls out of them.

**Generally available.** It says Lead, Deal and Quotation, and it has to survive
people whose sales process is not the first customer's.

# ERPNext's own eight, in the order it creates them — which is the order a deal
# moves through and is nowhere in the schema: `Sales Stage` has a name and
# nothing else, so a board drawn from it comes out in whatever order the values
# happened to arrive in. A pipeline whose columns are not in pipeline order is
# not a pipeline, so the order is declared here and `board.arrangement` carries
# it to the browser.
#
# A workspace that renames or reorders its stages does so in a saved view, which
# is the same mechanism one layer down — see `onespace/board.py`.

#
# ERPNext records a deal's value, its stage, its probability and the date it is

# sorted by date, not a list of deals sorted by value.
#
# The same pair on Lead and on Opportunity, because a lead you are nurturing has
# next steps for months before it becomes a deal, and losing them at the moment
# of conversion is how a qualified lead goes quiet.
#
# Applied by the tenant sync the first time it sees this space and never again.
