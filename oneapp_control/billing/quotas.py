"""What a workspace is actually allowed, and where that number comes from.

Quotas used to be read live from the Plan doctype. That made every price-sheet
edit retroactive: tidying a plan re-quotaed everyone already on it, and someone
who bought 50GB could wake up with 20GB without having agreed to anything.
Stripe grandfathers the *price* by leaving the old Price on the subscription;
this does the same for everything that price bought.

So the terms are copied onto the Subscription when it is sold, and enforcement
reads the copy. Editing a Plan then changes what new customers get, and an
operator moves an existing subscription onto new terms deliberately, with
`adopt_current_terms`.

This module is the only thing that decides which of the two to read. Nothing
else should reach for `Plan.storage_gb` to answer "what is this tenant allowed"
— `tests/test_quotas.py` checks that it doesn't.
